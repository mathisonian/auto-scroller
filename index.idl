  Several days ago [Maarten Lambrechts](https://twitter.com/maartenzam) —
  creator of the great [rocknpoll.graphics](http://rocknpoll.graphics) —
  wrote on twitter asking if it would create an article with
  similar navigation using Idyll.

  [ReactTweetEmbed id:"920403425808080896" options:`{conversation: 'none'}` /]

  It is!

  [action onClick:`state = 'overview' `] Scroll on to find out more... [/action]
[/Scroll.Section]

[Scroll.Section name:"overview"]
To simplify things, I created a `Scroll` component that will scroll to a particular
section based on its input value. The Idyll markup looks something like this:

```
[var name:"currentSection" value:"1" /]
[Scroll section:currentSection]
  [Section name:"1"] This is section 1... [/Section]
  [Section name:"2"] This is section 2... [/Section]
  [Section name:"2"] This is section 3... [/Section]
[/Scroll]
```

To trigger a scroll to the next section, simply update that `currentSection` variable:

```
[button onClick:`currentSection++` ]
  Click me to go to the next section!
[/button]
```


[button onClick:`state = 'interaction'; color = true; ` ]
  Click me to go to the next section!
[/button]
  [/Scroll.Section]

[Scroll.Section name:"interaction"]
  This scrolling code can be used in conjunction with the variables powering the rest of
  document. For example:

  Add Point: [button onClick:`pointCount+=1 ` ] Add point [/button]

  Remove Point: [button onClick:`pointCount-=1 ` ] Remove point [/button]

  Toggle Color: [button onClick:`color = !color ` ] Toggle color[/button]

  [action onClick:`state = 'end' `] Click to continue... [/action]
[/Scroll.Section]

[Scroll.Section name:"end"]
  Thanks for reading. The code for this can be found at: [https://github.com/mathisonian/auto-scroller](https://github.com/mathisonian/auto-scroller). See the README file in that repo for instructions on
